# Hi, I’m Geoffre Hutinet (@geoffreyhutinet)

## About Me

I am a researcher in the Microbiology and Cell Science department of the University of FLorida. I am curently working on a DNA modification system in bacteriophages. I have interests in predicting the presence of these modifications based on presence of certain genes that encodes for the proteins involved in the biosynthesis pathway of these modifications.

I’m currently learning how to design AI in python to process biological data such as proteomes and genomes to enhance the prediction of functional group of ortholog, to obtain better prediction of the general metabolisms of organisms.
